Installation
============

1. Upload zip file to Joomla! / Mambo using component installer.
2. Once you installed it you may want to add it to your menu. 

Note that the script will work without adding it to menu.
Then it can be accessed directly by typing index.php?option=com_userlist

Done!

You can setup several configuration options in the component admin.

You can select the language, set how many rows per page you want displayed
and which entries you want listed.

The translation and look & feel can easily be performed by editing the language file.
This can be done online too through the administration panel.
